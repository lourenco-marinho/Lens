Features

- [x] Chainable method calls
- [x] Generics Support

Requirements
--
- iOS 7.0+ / Mac OS X 10.9+

Installation
--
To use Lens with a Objective-C project, you must include all the files in the Source directory in your project. If you're in a Swift only project you just need to include the `Lens.swift` file in your project.

Usage

### Query all objects from a single entity
```swift
lens(forEntity: Person.self, managedObjectContext).look();
```

### Query entities based on their properties.
```swift
lens(forEntity: Person.self, managedObjectContext).find(@"name").equals(@"John").look();
```

### Compound your queries.
```swift
lens(forEntity: Person.self, managedObjectContext).find(@"name").equals(@"John").and(@"age").equals(26).look();
```

### Sort your results
```swift
lens(forEntity: Person.self, inContext: managedObjectContext).sort("name", ascending: true).look();
```
